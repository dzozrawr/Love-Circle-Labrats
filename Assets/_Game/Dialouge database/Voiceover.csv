Player_1_1,Player,,What type of grocery store shopper are you?\r
Contestant_1_1_2,Contestant 1,,I always think that I don’t need a cart and end up using my shirt as a bag.\r
Contestant_2_1_3,Contestant 2,,I guess that I’m the inspector hahah. I always triple check everything before I buy it.
Contestant_3_1_4,Contestant 3,,"Just a normal one, you know. I just leave my cart in the middle of the row and go to the other asle to get what I need."
Contestant_4_1_5,Contestant 4,,Mmmm I guess I like to open snacks and eat while I shop. I pay for the open bag at the end. Although I sometimes eat the whole bag of chips and hide the empty bag behind products so I don’t have to pay for it.
Contestant_5_1_6,Contestant 5,,I don’t see a point in grocery shopping. There is just always food in the fridge. Right?

Contestant_2_1_15,Contestant 2,,"Ew, that is the grossest thing ever. Who even puts fruit on pizza."
Contestant_3_1_16,Contestant 3,,BEST. COMBINATION. EVER. Like omg tasty.
